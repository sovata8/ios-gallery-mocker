## Welcome

This app generates some images / videos for testing purposes.
You have the option to overlay a random text and tint on top of the images (note this is resource intensive).

## ToDo / Known issues
- Multi add is not smart and allocates too much memory, causes crashes.
- Multi add should have better UI feedback - like progress (done count out of total count), seconds taken etc.
- UI transitions and animations are not ideal.
- Code: A lot of repetition and things in the wrong place.
